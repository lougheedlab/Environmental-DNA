Title: Integrating eDNA and community science observations to model distribution of a temperate freshwater turtle near its northern range limit

SWD files:

SWD files are organized as per required by MaxEnt program. 4 files are provided: NHIC only occurrences in Rideua region, NHIC only occurrences in Southern Ontario region, NHIC + eDNA occurrences in Rideua region, and NHIC + eDNA occurrences in Southern Ontario region. All files come with 40 environmental variables intilialy put into MaxEnt optimization framework (see MS methods section and supplemental information). Note that the coordinates of _S. odoratus_ presence do not indicate the turle's physical presence, they are the centroids of 1 sq km grid cells where the turtles were reported. This process obscures the true distribution of _S. odoratus_, which is a protected species in Canada.

These data can by used by others for their research projects once the paper has been reviewed and when it is accepted for publication.
