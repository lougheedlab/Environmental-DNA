Title: Integrating eDNA and community science observations to model distribution of a temperate freshwater turtle near its northern range limit

## SWD files:

SWD files are organized as required by MaxEnt. Four files are provided: Natural Heritage Information Centre (NHIC) only occurrences for musk turtles in the Rideau region, NHIC only occurrences in Southern Ontario region, NHIC + environmental DNA (eDNA) occurrences in the Rideau region, and NHIC + eDNA occurrences in Southern Ontario region. All files include the 40 environmental variables for the  MaxEnt optimization framework (see MS methods section and Supplemental Information). Note that the coordinates of _S. odoratus_ presence do not indicate the turle's physical presence, they are the centroids of 1 sq km grid cells where the turtles were reported or detected. This process obscures the true distribution of _S. odoratus_, which is a protected species in Canada.
